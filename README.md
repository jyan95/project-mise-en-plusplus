A single page web app designed to help with your kitchen adventures!

## Motivation

We wanted to create something to help stay organized when it came to cooking multiple dishes and keeping track of their respective ingredients and instructions.

## Tech stack

<b>Built with</b>
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) Frontend
- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) Backend 
- [Semantic](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)

## Features

- dynamic to-do lists separated by stage to more easily keep track of recipe ingredients / instructions
- homemade API for recipes, ingredients, and instructions
  
## Installation

1. Clone this repository and navigate to `/backend`, and run `gem install bundler`, then `bundle`
2. run `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:seed`, then run `rails s` (it will default to http://localhost:3000)
3. navigate to `/frontend` and run `npm install`, then `npm start` - it will prompt you to run on another port, hit `y`
4. if it does not automatically open in your browser, navigate to http://localhost:3001
